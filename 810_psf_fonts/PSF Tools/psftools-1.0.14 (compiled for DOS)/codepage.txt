Code pages supported by psftools
================================

The following codepages are supported by this version of psftools:

ISO codepages
=============

8859-1	} The ISO-8859 codepages. Most of them map the Codepage 437 characters
8859-2	} (smiley face, card suits etc.) into the control code area from
8859-3	} characters 00h to 1Fh. The exceptions are -13, -14 and -16, which
8859-4	} leave this area blank.
8859-5	}
8859-6	}
8859-7	}
8859-8	}
8859-9	}
8859-10	}
8859-13	}
8859-14	}
8859-15	}
8859-16	}

ISO codepages: Aliases
======================

  The following numeric aliases also refer to the ISO codepages, allowing 
them to be incorporated in CPI files:

8859-1: 	CP819	CP28591
8859-2: 	CP912	CP28592
8859-3: 	CP913	CP28593
8859-4: 	CP914	CP28594
8859-5: 	CP915	CP28595
8859-6: 	[*]	CP28596
8859-7: 	CP813	CP28597
8859-8: 	CP916	CP28598
8859-9: 	CP920	CP28599
8859-10:	CP919

[*] Various sources also suggest that either CP189 or CP1089 would be an 
alias for 8859-6; but without more evidence I can't be sure which.

OEM codepages
=============

CP367	US-ASCII: Only characters 32-126 are mapped. So (for example) 
        psfxform --codepage=367 will extract only ASCII characters.

CP437	The infamous IBM PC hardware codepage. 

CP737	Greek			} All of these have the same symbols as 
CP775	Baltic Rim		} Codepage 437 in positions 0x00-0x1F and 
CP850	International		} position 0x7F.
CP852	Eastern Europe		}
CP855	Cyrillic		}
CP857	Turkish			}
CP858	CP850 with Euro sign	}
CP860	Portugese		}
CP861	Icelandic		}
CP862	Hebrew			}
CP863	French Canadian		}
CP864	Arabic			}
CP865	Nordic			}
CP866	Russian			}
CP869	Greek			}
CP874	Thailand		}

Windows codepages
=================

CP1250	Windows Latin-2		} These all leave positions 0x00-0x1F and 0x7f
CP1251	Windows Cyrillic	} blank.
CP1252	Windows Latin-1
CP1253	Windows Greek
CP1254	Windows Turkish
CP1255	Windows Hebrew
CP1256	Windows Arabic
CP1257	Windows Baltic
CP1258	Windows Vietnamese

Custom codepages
================

AMSTRAD	  Amstrad PCW. The PCW character 7Fh (zero without a slash) is mapped
          to U+FF10 (full-width zero) for want of anything better.

BBCMICRO  BBC Micro: Only characters 32-127 are mapped, since that is all
	  the BBC Micro ROM defines.

PCGEM	  The character mapping used by the video drivers in Intel GEM. 
	  Character 0x0A (picture of a bell) has been mapped to U+237E 
          (symbol for a bell) -- not ideal.

PPC437    The codepages used by the character ROM on Amstrad PPC laptops and 
PPC860    their desktop counterpart, the Sinclair PC200. These differ slightly
PPC865    from the standard codepages 437, 860 and 865 to avoid confusion 
PPCGREEK  between the 'epsilon' and 'element-of' characters.
